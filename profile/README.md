#  Hard Mode Engineering

> **Forging production-ready engineers through real-world software.**

Hard Mode Engineering is an open-source engineering organization focused on building **realistic, production-grade systems** — not toy projects.

We believe great engineers are forged by:
- Solving real problems
- Thinking in systems
- Writing secure, scalable code
- Reviewing and being reviewed

Hard Mode Engineering exists to simulate **how real tech companies build software**, openly.

##  Our Philosophy

Most open-source projects optimize for *features*.

We optimize for:
- **Architecture**
- **Security**
- **Scalability**
- **Maintainability**
- **Engineering discipline**

Every repository inside Hard Mode Engineering is designed to answer one question:

> *“Would this code survive in production?”*

##  What You’ll Find Here

###  Production-Grade Systems
Well-structured services and applications built with real-world constraints:
- Authentication systems
- Payment abstractions
- Messaging engines
- APIs with proper validation, logging, and error handling
- Frontend systems with performance and UX in mind

Each project includes:
- Clear architecture decisions
- Trade-offs explained
- Thoughtful folder structures
- Clean commit history

---

###  Broken-by-Design Labs
Some repositories are **intentionally flawed**.

These labs are built to:
- Train debugging skills
- Teach secure coding
- Simulate real vulnerabilities
- Practice code reviews

You’ll find:
- Hidden bugs
- Security flaws
- Race conditions
- Anti-patterns

Solutions live in separate branches or documented walkthroughs.

---

### Engineering Playbooks
Shared standards and internal-style documentation, including:
- Backend best practices
- Frontend architecture guides
- Security checklists
- Code review standards
- Naming conventions and patterns

These playbooks reflect how strong engineering teams actually work.

---

##  Contribution Culture

Hard Mode Engineering is open — but **not careless**.

We value:
- Clean, meaningful commits
- Clear pull requests
- Thoughtful reviews
- Respect for standards

Every contribution is treated like it would be in a professional engineering team.

> Quality > Quantity. Always.

---

##  Who Hard Mode Engineering Is For

- Developers who want to move beyond tutorials
- Engineers who care about code quality
- Learners who want real-world exposure
- Contributors who enjoy being challenged
- Recruiters looking for signal, not noise

---

##  Tech Stack (Evolving)

Hard Mode Engineering projects may use:
- TypeScript / JavaScript
- Node.js / Backend frameworks
- Modern frontend tooling
- Databases, caching, and queues
- Security best practices by default

Tools evolve — principles don’t.

---

##  Leadership

Hard Mode Engineering is founded and maintained by **Manzi Rurangirwa Elvis**,  
a developer focused on building secure, scalable systems and pushing engineering standards higher.

---

##  Final Note

Hard Mode Engineering is not about perfection.

It’s about:
- Thinking deeply
- Building responsibly
- Learning publicly
- Forging engineers who can handle real production systems

Welcome to the Hard Mode.
